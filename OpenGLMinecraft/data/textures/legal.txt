R3D CRAFT is a recreation of the default texture pack in Minecraft, created by Mojang.
R3D CRAFT is made and published by Thomas Angeland @UniblueMedia.

Painting-textures: Images used in paintings_kristoffer_zetterstrand.png (paintings in Minecraft) are made by Kristoffer Zetterstrand. Kristoffer Zetterstrand is represented by Peter Bergman gallery. These are original images that the Mojang team uses for their default paintings. I claim no authorship over paintings_kristoffer_zetterstrand.png.
